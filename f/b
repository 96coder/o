            "desc": "Setup\nThe instructions in this post are for a minimum of 6 players, but you can practice this drill with only 2 players, so it is ideal for training sessions with low attendance. If you have good attendance, split the players into pairs (1 versus 1). If possible, matchup defensive with offensive players. If you have odd numbers, the last player to arrive at practice will be out.\n\nYou don’t need an actual football pitch but enough space for the players and goals. In addition, you will need 1 ball per pair, 2 small goals per pair of players, and enough cones to mark swim lanes (see picture above). If you can’t get hold of small goals, use cones. \n\nInstructions\nThis drill is a simple 1v1 football game, so the standard football rules apply. However, to increase the intensity and make it fun, these rules also apply:\n\nSliding tackles are not allowed\nWhen the ball is out or a goal is scored, the player restarting the game must do it from their goal regardless of where the ball went out.   \nEach matchup lasts 5 minutes.\nWhen the time is over, one of the players moves to the next zone to match up with a different player. For example, in the picture above, the red players move to the next zone to their right. The player on the last zone on the right moves to the first zone on the left.\nThe drill finishes when every possible matchup has been completed. For example, in our picture, the drill finishes when the player who started on the leftmost zone ends the matchup on the rightmost zone.\nEach win is worth 2 points.\nEach draw is worth 1 point.\nThe player that scores the most goals earns 1 extra point.\nThe player with fewer goals against earns 1 extra point.\nThe player with more points wins.\nTakeaways\nThe best players in the world learned the game by playing pickup games in the streets or fields of their neighbourhood. Often just getting a friend and kicking the ball around. It was all about having fun while competing against mates. This football dribbling drill brings back that spirit and, in the process, improves:\n\nDribbling skills\nDefensive skills in 1v1 situations\nShooting accuracy. Because the game is played with small goals, it encourages a clinical finish.\nPatience when defending. Not allowing sliding tackles forces defenders to be patient. Defenders practice how to recover the ball, avoiding reckless defending.\nFitness. This game is physically demanding because there is a time limit, and players compete not just with their matchup but against players in other zones.\nBall control with both feet. Players that can play with both feet are more likely to win this game."

            "desc": "Training for fitness without a ball can be very dull and fruitless. After all, players don’t train to be marathonists. This post shares a few football fitness drills with a ball that will make your training more enjoyable.\n\nWhy conditioning with a ball\nIn the past, conditioning was approached separately without a ball. If you are 40+ like me, you will remember endless running sessions and all sorts of aerobic exercises. In many training sessions, you wouldn’t touch a ball at all! The belief was that team fitness would translate into a dominating team.\n\nToday, we know that fitness is not enough and that individual and team skills must be on par with fitness, and the best way to increase skills is by practising with a ball as much as possible. FIFA recommends training with the ball using Global and Analytical methods. The former isolates elements of the game, while the latter simulates real game scenarios. The drills in this post are Analytical.  \n\nAside from the technical disadvantages of only focussing on fitness, training without a ball is boring. Furthermore, in the context of grassroots/amateur football, you risk low attendance to your training or players simply leaving your team. Therefore, we prefer running football fitness drills with a ball and making them competitive to keep the intensity.\n\nDrills preparation\nWe recommend that you use one of these drills after a warming-up. Many of the drills in this post require explosive movements,  so practising them when your muscles are cold can lead to injuries, especially the older you get.\n\nYou will need balls, cones and dummies for the drills below. You don’t need top-of-the-line balls for these exercises. However, when possible, train with the same balls used for the tournaments you play. Cones and mannequins are ideal, but you can use anything as markers: jumpers, backpacks, rocks, etc. Have a look at the recommended equipment below.\n\nDrill 1 – Passing  circuit\nYou need four mannequins or poles to set up a diamond-like shape circuit. Each side is 10 meters long, while the diagonals are 15 and 13 meters long.\n\nYou can use from two players to three players for this drill. More players will slow down the intensity of the exercise as players will stay waiting in line. So, if you have a good number of players, you can have groups running this exercise in parallel. Then, to increase the intensity, you can make it competitive by rewarding the group that finishes first the circuit.\n\nUsing as reference the animation below, the progression for this fitness drill is:\n\nThe red player starts sprinting in mannequin 1 towards mannequin 2 while the blue player waits in mannequin 3 to serve the ball to the red player.\nThe blue player serves a ball to the outside of mannequin 2. The red player returns the ball in 1 touch and moves to the inside of the mannequin.\nThe red player sprints towards mannequin 3 on the inside of the diamond.\nThe blue player serves a ball to the outside of mannequin 3, and the red player returns the ball in one touch.\nThe blue player passes the ball again but to the inside of mannequin 3. Since the serving player is standing in mannequin 3, these passes are quick and short.\nThe red player sprints towards mannequin 4 on the inside of the diamond.\nThe blue player serves a ball to the outside of mannequin 2. The red player returns the ball in 1 touch and sprints towards mannequin 1.\nThe red player sprints towards mannequin 1.\nAs soon as the red player starts sprinting, the grey player waiting in mannequin 1 starts the circuit.\nRepeat this progression 3 times, then change the serving player. In total, each player in the group should have done 9 laps of the circuit. As discussed, if you have multiple groups, make it a competition between groups to see who finishes the drill first.\n\nFootball fitness drills with a ball - Passing circuit\nDrill 2 – Ball control\nYou need 3 balls and 6 discs to mark a grid of two squares, as shown in the animation below. The sides of each square are 10 meters long.\n\nLike in Drill 1, limit the number of players to a maximum of three to keep the intensity of the exercise. If you have more players, have different groups running this exercise simultaneously and reward the group that finishes their circuit first.\n\nUsing as reference the animation below, the progression for this fitness drill is:\n\nThe first player starts by dribbling the ball at full speed from the first disc to the second disc.\nStops the ball on top of the disc or as close to it as possible.\nChanges direction 90 degrees towards the third disc and sprints as fast as possible to the next disc without the ball.\nPicks the ball on top of the third disc and turns 90 degrees again.\nDribbles the ball at full speed towards the fourth disc and repeats the sequence above until reaching the last disc: dribbling with the ball, leaving the ball, sprinting and so on.\nOnce the player reaches the last cone, repeats the drill backwards towards the first disc and leaves the balls in their original position.\nThe next player starts the circuit as soon as the previous player stops the ball on the first disc.\nRepeat this progression 6 times per player. As discussed, if you have multiple groups, make it a competition between groups to see who finishes the drill first.\n\nFootball fitness drills with a ball - Ball control\nDrill 3 – One-touch short passing\nThe setup of this exercise is simple. You need a ball and 6 cones spread in a straight line. You only need 2 players, so this is a perfect drill to practice with a friend anywhere and anytime. In a team training session, you will need plenty of space to have pair of players running this exercise in parallel.\n\nThis football fitness drill is excellent to warm up because you’re actually on the move, so you’re getting the blood flowing and adding a technical element to it. As shown in the animation below, the progression is simple:\n\nThe blue player passes the ball to the red player through the first gate formed by the cones.\nThe red player returns the ball to the blue player through the next gate.\nPlayers keep passing the ball as above until reaching the last gate.\nOnce players reach the end of the line of cones, they start again in the opposite direction.\nRepeat for 5 minutes or more.\nAs you get familiar with the drill, increase the difficulty. For example, start with unlimited touches, followed by only two touches, and finally execute the routine using a single touch. In addition, run the exercise using the players’ weakest foot for a few minutes.  \n\nFootball fitness drills with a ball - Short passing\nDrill 4 – Throw-ins\nThe previous drills focused on your lower body and ball control. However, you also need your upper body to be strong. Therefore, you won’t build up your arms and core muscles with a few drills. Instead, you need to target those with weight training or other alternatives. Still, exercises like those in this section and the next will increase your overall fitness and improve other football skills, such as headers and throw-ins.\n\nThe throw-in drill is a very popular drill and very simple. You only need a ball per pair of players for this drill. You can practice alone with a partner or align all the team in pairs (as shown in the animation below). The progression is as follows:\n\nA player starts by executing a throw-in to the feet of their teammate.\nThe receiving player attempts to stop the ball in one touch.\nWhen the ball is entirely still, the player lifts the ball and executes a throw-in back to the first player. Again, ensure it is all done in a single smooth movement.\nRepeat for 5 minutes or more.\nThis drill will accomplish three things in one shot: warm-up and increase the fitness of the upper body (arms and core), improve the throw-in technique and improve the one-touch reception of thrown-ins. The latter two aspects are critical. It is frustrating and silly to lose possession from a poorly executed throw-in.\n\nThrow-ins\nDrill 5 – Headers and throw-ins\nThe setup and progression of this exercise are similar to the previous drill. However, instead of throwing the ball to the feet of a teammate, the starting player throws the ball head high or higher, and the receiving player returns it with a header. We combine the header with the previous drill to avoid only one player heading the ball. Below we outline the exact routine:\n\nA player starts by throwing the ball at their teammate’s head or higher to allow a header.\nThe receiving player returns the ball with the header aimed at the feet of the first player.\nThe first player attempts to stop the ball in one touch.\nWhen the ball is entirely still, the player lifts the ball and executes a throw-in back to their teammate but this time aimed at their feet.\nThe receiving player attempts to stop the ball in one touch.\nWhen the ball is entirely still, the player lifts the ball and starts the progression above again but with the roles inverted. That is, the player throws the ball at their teammate’s head or higher, and so on.\nRepeat for 5 minutes or more.\nIn addition to improving fitness and throw-ins, this drill will help players with the accuracy of their headers."

            "title": "Football pressing drill – Press and cover",
            "thumbnail": "https://i.ibb.co/gSyKjSX/Why-two-touches.jpg",
            "desc": "Pressing is a popular strategy to recover the ball. However, it can expose the defending team to counterattacks. This post describes a football pressing drill that will help your team to press in an organised manner.\n\nSetup\nThis routine is a competition between your defence and your offensive players. Therefore you need a good number of players: 4 defenders and 8 offensive players. Because this drill emulates a back line of 4 players, you need 3/4 width of a football field and 3/4 of one-half of the field to emulate the opposition midfield passing the ball to their forwards. If you are using a football field and have a considerable number of players, you can simultaneously run 2 to 3 groups along the field.\n\nIn addition to an actual field, you will need cones and balls. If you can’t get hold of a full pitch, find a park with enough space and use cones to mark the playing field.\n\nYou can still run this drill if you have a low number of players turning up to training, but you need a minimum of 9 players: 3 defenders and 6 offensive players. Instead of 4 lanes, you use 3 lanes. In this scenario, you can still emulate a backline of 3 players. A variation with fewer players (e.g., 2 defenders) won’t simulate a real scenario.\n\nInstructions\nPressing is a strategy in which the defending team presses over the player with the ball instead of holding back (waiting to intercept the ball or for the opposition to make a mistake). Teams can use this strategy anywhere in the field and in many different ways. This football pressing drill focuses on the defensive line and is particularly useful for teams that press the opposition using a high line tactic. Therefore the instructions below are designed for practising pressing while covering gaps that may expose your team.\n\nThe progression and rules of the game are as follows.\n\nAttacking players:\nmove inside their square only.\nare only allowed two touches.\ncan pass the ball to a teammate in a contiguous square or on the opposite side of the field.\nget 1 point every time they successfully pass the ball to the other side of the playing field.\nDefending players:\ncan move everywhere in their lane, including the square of the attacking player, but can’t change lanes.\ndiscount a point from the attacking players when they recover the ball.\nare not allowed sliding tackles.\nA ball is considered recovered when it is controlled. Therefore, deflecting the ball or kicking it out of the game is not enough to regain possession.\nIf a player breaks one of the rules above, a point is awarded or discounted from the opposite team.\nIf the attacking team still have points at the end of a set time (e.g., 10 minutes) wins the game.\nThe defending team wins if the attacking team has no points at the end of the set time.\nBe creative and add your own rules. But, whatever changes you make to the base game, maintain the spirit of the drill.\n\nTakeaways\nThis football pressing drill will improve your team’s organisation when defending. However, this routine also improves possession of the ball and finding gaps in the opposition defence. In summary, this exercise will improve:\n\nAccurate passing. The only way to win this game is by players improving their passing technique.\nFirst touch. Because the number of allowed touches is restricted, players must improve their first touch to control and pass the ball.\nTeamwork. This drill encourages teamwork over individual efforts. Defenders must coordinate their movements to press and cover gaps.\nPositioning. Defending players have to position themselves to close passing lanes.\nPatience. Offensive players must circulate the ball to find the killer pass and avoid rushing a pass.\nPatience when defending. Not allowing sliding tackles forces defenders to be patient. Defenders practice how to recover the ball, avoiding reckless defending.\nFitness. This game is physically demanding for the defending players."

            "desc": "Creating triangles in the pitch is a common offensive strategy that enables a team to quickly move the ball. This post breaks down a one-touch attacking triangle drill to break the defence and create a shooting opportunity at the edge of the box.\n\nSetup\nFor this drill, you will need cones and a full-size goal. With the cones, create two lines about 3 metres long, one on the penalty spot and the other inside the semi-circle outside the box. Locate the starting cone about 5 metres outside the box. You can practice this drill with a goalkeeper or use target nets in the goal. This exercise requires 3 to 4 players: 3 players attacking and 1 goalkeeper or target nets. \n\nInstructions\nThe players in the box move in opposite directions. For example, if the front player moves to receive the ball on the right, the back player must move to the right, and vice-versa. First, the starting player passes the ball to the front player, who returns the ball using one touch. Then, the starting player passes the ball to the back player through the gap. Finally, the back player passes the ball to the front player, who shoots on goal. After shooting, players rotate positions.\n\nThe pictures created with Tactics Manager and the videos at the end of this post illustrate how this triangle drill works.\n\n Remember these key points:\n\n3 players are required for this drill.\nPlayers inside the box constantly move in opposite directions.\nThe ball is moved in triangles.\nOnly one touch is allowed (shooting is considered a touch).\nTakeaways\nThis drill aims to create shooting opportunities by moving the ball in a one-touch attacking triangle. Players will improve these skills:\n\nReading the game. The back player keeps an eye on his teammate to move in the opposite direction. The starting player observes both players and passes the ball through the gap created.\nCreating space. This exercise encourages intelligent movements from the offensive players to open the defence.\nOne-touch passing. Quick one-touch passes create gaps in the defence that can be exploited for penetration passes or shooting at goal.\nShooting. Do not execute this drill without a goalkeeper or target nets. You want every shooting opportunity to count.\nKeep the intensity of the exercise and mix up the players’ movements so the drill becomes less predictable. Remember that the objective is to break the defence with quick passes. One variation you may want to consider is using defenders to pressure the players in the box. Be creative and create your own versions of this drill."
